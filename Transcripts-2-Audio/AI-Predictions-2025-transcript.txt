Intro
0:00
well Happy New Year surprisingly there
0:02
hasn't been a ton of AI announcements
0:04
between Christmas and New Year's okay
0:07
maybe that's not that surprising but
0:09
there has been a few I'm going to
0:11
quickly break down the few small
0:12
announcements that happened over the
0:14
last few days but then I'm going to
0:15
spend more time on predictions of what I
0:19
believe is going to happen with AI in
0:20
2025 as well as what you think is going
0:23
to happen in 2025 I asked you guys over
0:25
on X what your predictions for AI and
0:27
other emerging Tech was in 2025 and
0:30
received 121 responses so we'll dig in a
0:33
little bit on both what I think is
0:36
coming in 2025 and what you guys think
0:38
is coming in 2025 but first here's a
0:40
quick rundown of the news that happened
0:42
in the last few days on December 27th
OpenAI Converting to For-Profit
0:45
open aai pretty much confirmed what
0:47
everybody saw coming in that they are
0:50
going to attempt to convert from a
0:52
nonprofit to a for-profit company they
0:55
believe that's the best way to make the
0:57
company more sustainable and actually
0:59
achieve their mission they plan to
1:01
transform the existing for-profit into a
1:03
Delaware Public benefit corporation
1:06
which requires the company to balance
1:07
shareholder interest stakeholder
1:09
interest and public benefit interest in
1:11
the decision-making the nonprofit would
1:13
essentially become an investor in the
1:15
for-profit they will hold a large amount
1:17
of equity in the new for-profit now this
Hinton Pushes Back
1:19
whole conversion of a nonprofit to a
1:22
for-profit has actually been met with
1:25
quite a bit of resistance from outside
1:27
companies Elon Musk has tried to block
1:30
this from actually happening and now the
1:32
Godfather of AI Jeffrey Hinton has also
1:35
said that he does not think it's in the
1:37
best interest for open AI to convert to
1:39
a for-profit open AI was founded as an
1:42
explicitly safety focused nonprofit and
1:45
made a variety of safety related
1:46
promises in its Charter it received
1:48
numerous tax and other benefits from its
1:51
nonprofit status allowing it to tear all
1:53
of that up when it becomes inconvenient
1:55
sends a very bad message to other actors
1:58
in the ecosystem so although open AI
2:01
wants to convert to a for-profit there
2:03
is still some opposition out there that
2:05
might try to block that from happening
2:07
I've mentioned in one of my recent live
2:09
streams that I personally don't find
2:11
this that exciting of information
2:14
because it doesn't really impact how I'm
2:16
currently using AI on a day-to-day basis
2:19
which is really the main focus of my
2:20
channel is how people can use this stuff
2:23
on a day-to-day basis but this is hot
2:25
and in the AI news right now so I
2:27
figured I would share this stuff quickly
OpenAI's Media Manager Never Happened
2:29
also I've seen a lot of the tech
2:30
websites point this out so I'll point it
2:32
out really quickly as well open AI
2:34
failed to deliver on the optout tool
2:36
that it promised by 2025 if you remember
2:38
back in May open AI said it was
2:40
developing something called the media
2:43
manager which was a tool that would
2:44
allow content creators and websites to
2:47
opt out of open aai training on any of
2:50
its data they said they intended to have
2:52
this launched by 2025 well we are
2:55
officially in 2025 and it hasn't even
2:57
launched and supposedly according to
3:00
people within open AI that feature was
3:03
rarely viewed as an important launch
3:05
internally someone who used to work at
3:07
open AI said I don't think it was a
3:08
priority to be honest I don't remember
3:10
anyone working on it so who knows if
3:13
it's even something that will ever get
3:15
created but as of right now we haven't
3:17
heard any more about it since back in
Google Gears Up for 2025
3:20
May Google who ended 2024 with a bang
3:24
showing off V2 the willow Quantum chip
3:27
their genie2 model new verions of Gemini
3:31
The Notebook LM it just seemed like
3:33
everything kind of came together for
3:35
Google at the end of 2024 and they seem
3:39
to be just getting started Google's CEO
3:42
told employees to gear up for a big 2025
3:45
he told employees I think 2025 will be
3:48
critical I think it's really important
3:49
we internalize the urgency of this
3:51
moment and need to move faster as a
3:53
company the stakes are high these are
3:55
disruptive moments in 2025 we need to be
3:58
relentlessly focused on unlocking the
4:00
benefits of this technology and solve
4:02
real user problems Google sort of had a
4:05
reputation during 2023 and a lot of 2024
4:10
of not shipping as fast as companies
4:13
like anthropic and open AI when it comes
4:15
to releasing AI they would show off
4:17
features but then not roll them out but
4:19
towards the end of 2025 they really
4:21
flipped that switch and started actually
4:23
releasing a lot of really really cool
4:25
stuff so Google is one of the companies
4:28
that I'm pretty excited to see what they
4:29
they produced in 2025 with the current
AI Clips Long Videos to Shorts
4:31
state of AI technology there's never
4:33
been a better time to get into creating
4:35
online video content so for today's
4:38
video I partnered with Opus clip because
4:40
it's been one of my secret weapons to
4:41
turn long form video content into tons
4:44
of short form content if you've been
4:46
watching my channel recently you've
4:47
probably noticed I've been doing live
4:49
streams lately well Opus clip has
4:50
allowed me to turn those live streams
4:52
into hundreds of short form clips that
4:55
I'm able to then publish on YouTube and
4:58
Instagram for thousand thousands and
5:00
thousands of extra views on my videos
5:02
you feed it one long form video it will
5:05
Analyze That video and find the clips
5:06
that are most likely to go viral as
5:09
short form Clips it also reframes the
5:11
entire video all of these were shot in a
5:14
16x9 wide format video Opus clip
5:17
automatically resized it to 9x6 put my
5:21
face on the videos and whatever I was
5:23
showing off on the clip on the video as
5:25
well and they keep adding new features
5:27
as well they've got an AI voiceover
5:29
feature a speech enhancer feature a
5:31
feature to automatically add b-roll and
5:33
their editor is really powerful I can
5:36
use AI to enhance the speech remove
5:38
filler words remove pauses even add
5:40
sensors to my videos if I don't like how
5:43
the clip was laid out I can easily
5:44
rearrange in the editor put my head on
5:47
the top of the video and the thing that
5:49
I'm showing on the bottom of the video
5:51
and just like that you're seeing the
5:53
secret to how I've managed to produce so
5:55
many short form videos off of one weekly
5:58
live stream opis clip has made it so
6:01
easy so if you're thinking about getting
6:02
into video content creation 2025 is the
6:05
year to do it tools like Opus clip make
6:08
it extremely easy to create loads of
6:11
valuable content and what you're seeing
6:13
on my various channels is proof of that
6:16
you can learn more about opis clip in
6:17
the link in the description and thank
6:19
you so much to opis clip for sponsoring
6:21
this video moving over to meta news real
Meta Wants Fake People on Social
6:23
quick this is something that I've heard
6:25
quite a bit about that I'm not super
6:27
excited about from meta apparent meta
6:30
wants to release a whole bunch of AI
6:33
fake people on platforms like Facebook
6:35
and Instagram to essentially provide
6:38
people that get very little engagement
6:40
with more engagement to make their
6:42
platforms more sticky and I personally
6:44
think this is a very weird like almost
6:46
dystopian move by meta now meta's made a
6:49
lot of good decisions and I love a lot
6:51
of what meta did but this is one where
6:53
I'm kind of stepping back and going is
6:55
this really where you want to take your
6:57
platforms the tech giant is planning to
6:59
roll out millions of generative AI
7:01
characters that will appear as users on
7:03
Facebook and Instagram so they're going
7:05
to make them look like real people on
7:07
these platforms we expect these AIS to
7:09
actually over time exist on our
7:11
platforms kind of in the same way that
7:13
accounts do they'll have bios and
7:15
profile pictures and be able to generate
7:17
and share content powered by AI on the
7:19
platform that's where we see all of this
7:21
going and this came directly from Connor
7:24
Hayes the vice president of product for
7:26
generative AI at meta this article says
7:28
that while Bots are typically viewed as
7:29
a negative aspect of navigating social
7:31
media platforms Met's decision to
7:33
purposefully introduce non-human users
7:36
into its social media ecosystem is
7:38
linked to the company's desire to appeal
7:39
to a younger generation of users so
7:42
while most of these social media
7:44
platforms are doing everything they can
7:45
to fight Bots and eliminate Bots meta's
7:49
idea of the future of social media is to
7:51
introduce a ton of new Bots and let
7:54
humans interact with Bots likely in a
7:56
way where they're not even realizing
7:58
they're interacting with Bots to
8:00
increase the stickiness and retention of
8:03
users on these social media platforms I
8:05
don't like that I personally not a fan
8:07
of where that is headed if I'm on social
8:10
media I want to know I'm interacting
8:11
with other humans I'm sure there's going
8:13
to be some sort of disclaimer that's
8:14
noting that they're talking to an AI but
8:17
their goal is definitely to create a
8:18
social media platform where people feel
8:20
like they're getting more engagement
8:22
even when that engagement isn't actually
8:24
coming from real humans this week
Hugging Face Smolagents
8:26
hugging faced introduced small agents
8:28
this is a simple library that unlocks
8:31
agentic capabilities for language models
8:33
now I haven't dug into this myself too
8:35
much but this appears to be a sweet of
8:37
tools available on hugging face that
8:40
allows anybody to create agents with
8:42
existing tools that are already out
8:44
there but it is something that I will
8:45
likely play around with in the future
8:47
and once I have a better understanding
8:49
of it I'll share more thoughts on it
Nvidia's Latest Acquisition
8:51
Nvidia this week closed an acquisition
8:53
on a software company called run AI it's
8:56
estimated that it cost Nvidia about 700
8:59
million dollars to acquire run aai and
9:02
if you're curious what run AI is it
9:03
appears to be a platform that helps
9:06
optimize AI infrastructure we can see in
9:08
the press release here it says in
9:09
addition we plan to open source the Run
9:11
AI software to help the community build
9:13
better AI faster while run AI currently
9:15
supports only Nvidia gpus open sourcing
9:18
the software will enable it to extend
9:20
its availability to the entire AI
9:22
ecosystem and in the last little bit of
Nintendo Switch 2 (With AI)
9:24
AI news that I'll share here there's a
9:25
new Nintendo patent that appears to
9:28
reveal switch 2 and the patent claims
9:31
that it's going to use deep learning
9:33
super sampling basically this is
9:35
technology that uses AI to upscale the
9:38
resolution of games effectively allowing
9:40
developers to achieve higher graphical
9:42
settings and better frame rates on
9:44
weaker Hardware so essentially what this
9:46
is saying is that the next version of
9:49
Nintendo switch they don't have to make
9:51
games that actually are in 4k they can
9:54
make the games in like 1080P or lower
9:56
resolution ship the games in that lower
9:59
resolution ution then when you play the
10:01
game on the device itself it's going to
10:04
upscale back up to like a 4K resolution
10:07
and give you that higher quality video
10:09
This is likely going to be the future of
10:11
a lot of game systems where they can
10:13
make smaller and smaller file sizes by
10:15
downscaling the resolution of the game
10:18
and then while you're actually playing
10:19
the game the console or the computer or
10:22
whatever you're using to play the game
10:24
then re-ups scales it back up into that
10:26
like 4K really really high def
10:29
definition video and that's pretty much
10:31
all the most interesting AI news that I
10:33
found for you this week some of it's not
10:35
even that interesting but I did want to
10:37
share what little news did trickle out
10:39
this week but now let's quickly talk
My Predictions for AI in 2025
10:41
about AI predictions for 2025 my number
10:44
one prediction is that 2025 is the year
10:47
of AI agents we're going to hear AI
10:49
agents everywhere we're going to hear
10:51
the word agentic a lot so much that
10:53
you're going to get sick of hearing the
10:55
word agentic because I think everybody
10:56
is going to build AI agents into their
10:58
platform and what I mean by AI agents is
11:01
using AI that can also use tools and do
11:04
things on your behalf imagine using Siri
11:07
to look up a flight for you help you
11:09
book it and then add it to your calendar
11:12
and it would do all of those steps for
11:13
you or telling your Google Assistant to
11:16
help you schedule a meeting with
11:18
somebody and your Google Assistant goes
11:20
and sends that email with somebody goes
11:22
and does some back and forth with emails
11:24
to confirm a time and once a time is
11:26
confirmed adds it to your calendar
11:28
things like that I think we're going to
11:29
see a lot more of in 2025 where you're
11:32
using some sort of like voice assistant
11:34
and it goes and takes actions on your
11:36
behalf we know that anthropic got huge
11:39
investments from Amazon this year so
11:41
your Amazon Alexa is probably going to
11:43
have much more of this kind of
11:44
Technology built into it we've seen what
11:46
Google is trying to do with Gemini and
11:48
their project Astra we've seen what
11:50
apple is doing by baking in AI into Siri
11:53
and connecting it to chat GPT we've seen
11:55
what meta is doing by Rolling AI into
11:58
all of their m messaging platforms so I
12:00
really really think all of them want
12:02
this sort of like agent tool use kind of
12:05
functionality Claude even put out their
12:07
tool use feature now it's not really
12:09
easy to set up for people yet it's like
12:11
a very very early testing sort of
12:13
scenario but they've already shown it
12:15
off and I've already played with Claud
12:17
that can use tools open AI said they're
12:19
expecting tool use to roll out in
12:21
January of 2025 for chat GPT and along
12:23
with that I think we're going to see
12:25
more AI baked into everything when I was
12:27
at CES last year they had AI in
12:29
refrigerators AI in laundry machines AI
12:31
in toilets AI in ovens AI in barbecues
12:35
AI pillows AI beds literally everything
12:38
had AI I'm going to CES like I mentioned
12:40
next week I'm expecting even more of
12:41
that like every Booth is going to have
12:43
some sort of Gadget but now with AI in
12:45
it I really think we're going to see
12:47
that I also think we're going to see a
12:49
lot more of the AI wearables like we're
12:51
going to see more of the sunglasses and
12:52
the earbuds and the wristbands and
12:54
things like that that have ai baked into
12:56
it the meta Ray bands were a big hit
12:58
they continue to sell well and do well
13:01
and meta already said that in 2025 they
13:03
think they're going to add some sort of
13:04
like heads up display in them so that
13:06
you can actually see text and subtitles
13:08
and things like that right in your eyes
13:10
inside of your sunglasses we already saw
13:12
that project Astra is going to get like
13:14
a glasses version soon so we're going to
13:16
see more of those wearables we've also
13:18
seen sneak peeks of like earbuds that
13:20
you can wear that will do automatic
13:21
translation for you and things like that
13:23
so wearables I think are going to be a
13:25
really really big thing in 2025 that
13:27
we'll hear a lot of talk about I
13:28
mentioned video models getting way
13:30
better from 2023 to 2024 and I think
13:33
we're going to see that Trend continue
13:35
Sam Alman from open AI said that there's
13:37
a lot of plans in the works for
13:39
improving Sora right now we have the
13:42
Sora turbo model we don't even have the
13:43
full Sora model yet so we're going to
13:45
see big leaps there we got V2 from
13:48
Google which most people still don't
13:49
have access to but it's really really
13:51
good we've got the Chinese models like
13:53
cing and Minx that are really really
13:56
good you've got Pika and Runway which
13:58
are both constant L innovating in their
14:00
own ways so we're going to see video
14:02
just get better and better and better in
14:04
2025 I imagine we're going to get videos
14:07
that are longer you know generate up to
14:09
a minute or longer with our AI videos
14:11
they're going to get higher quality the
14:13
physics understanding is going to get a
14:15
lot better where they understand which
14:18
leg is the you know the leg that's
14:20
furthest from the camera and which leg
14:21
is the closest to the camera and
14:23
understanding environments a little bit
14:24
better I really think the AI video is
14:27
going to get really really good in 2025
14:30
like it's already pretty good I think
14:31
it's going to get to that
14:33
indistinguishable from is this a real
14:35
video or is this generated with AI I
14:37
think people are going to have trouble
14:38
determining the difference I think we're
14:40
going to see more self-driving Tech in
14:42
2025 we know Tesla's got their cyber
14:44
taxi which is coming out in 2026 but we
14:47
also know there's companies like weimo
14:49
who are connected with Uber there's
14:51
rumors that Amazon might try to work
14:54
some sort of acquisition with lft and
14:56
work in autonomous vehicles into lift as
14:58
well and I think a lot of these
15:00
companies are going to try to do this
15:02
stuff before the robo taxis or cyber
15:04
taxis or whatever they're called are
15:06
released by Tesla I think weimo is going
15:08
to try to get ahead of it uh Amazon has
15:10
a company called zuk I think zox which
15:13
also makes like autonomous little like
15:15
buses and vehicles and things so I think
15:17
if they end up working with Lyft really
15:19
closely we might see Lyft actually have
15:22
autonomous vehicles inside of their
15:23
Fleet as well so I think we're going to
15:25
see a lot of that bubble up even more in
15:27
2025 I I think we're going to hear a lot
15:30
more talk about Quantum Computing we
15:32
recently saw that Willow chip from
15:34
Google which made huge leaps in what
15:37
quantum computers can do and minimizing
15:40
the error rates of these quantum
15:42
computers IBM has similar chips that
15:44
they're working on that are going to be
15:46
released in 2025 and I think the talk
15:49
around Quantum Computing is really going
15:51
to Bubble Up more and more in 2025 so
15:54
those are really my predictions for 2025
15:56
AI agents AI baked into every
15:59
more and more wearables like glasses
16:01
with heads up displays and earbuds that
16:03
can automatically translate things the
16:05
continued progression of video models
16:07
they're only going to get better and
16:09
more impressive in 2025 more and more of
16:11
the self-driving Tech and self-driving
16:14
cabs like the wio like the zuk like the
16:17
Tesla version and finally a lot more
16:20
talk around Quantum Computing I'm sure
16:22
there's quite a bit that I am missing
16:24
and also my timelines are often very off
16:27
but I really think those are the are I
16:29
we'll see a lot more in 2025 now I'm
Your Predictions for AI in 2025
16:31
going to do a quick runr of some of your
16:33
predictions that you shared on X with me
16:35
I actually haven't even read most of
16:37
these yet some of them I kind of
16:38
accidentally saw in my notifications but
16:40
most of these I haven't read yet so
16:42
baval says AI video shatters the visual
16:45
Turing test totally agree that's one of
16:47
the things I predict as well Jason
16:48
Moffett one of my buddies he says I
16:50
think unless you're way ahead of the
16:52
curve many people are going to be
16:53
penalized using AI because it's creating
16:55
so much of the same old same old from
16:57
people who aren't very creative I with
16:59
that from like a Content marketing
17:01
standpoint I think if you're relying on
17:03
AI a little too heavily to create your
17:04
content for blog posts and things like
17:06
that it's probably not going to do super
17:08
well but if you're using AI in other
17:10
ways like if you're using AI to create
17:13
really good videos really good AI
17:15
imagery using it to help like brainstorm
17:18
ideas things like that I still think AI
17:21
is really really valuable I just think
17:23
AI generated content is also going to
17:25
create just a flood of AI sort of slop
17:27
on the internet and that I'm not looking
17:29
forward to but I also think Google and
17:31
some of these platforms are going to
17:32
figure out how to sort of drank that
17:34
stuff right now it's really really tough
17:36
for algorithms to tell whether or not
17:37
something was AI generated I think
17:39
that's only going to get harder but I
17:41
also think a lot of these AI generation
17:43
tools might do some sort of like water
17:45
marking thing to help determine whether
17:47
it was generated with AI or not we'll
17:49
see I don't know I don't know how that's
17:50
going to play out I think SEO in general
17:53
is just going to be totally overhauled
17:55
pretty soon as a result of AI the way we
17:57
search is changing we Now sort of ask
17:59
questions and use prompts instead of
18:01
searching as much and the way we create
18:03
content is changing because it's so
18:04
effortless to create content now so I
18:06
just think SEO as a whole is going to
18:09
change a lot Johannes Copeland says
18:11
we're going to get damn close to AGI
18:12
with agents that actually work
18:14
effectively replacing large parts of
18:16
existing jobs couldn't agree more Nick
18:17
silver says I personally think 2025 is
18:19
the year of AI agents I think that a lot
18:22
of people that are paying attention to
18:23
like the AI verse C AI agents is the
18:25
next thing if you do want to post a blog
18:28
post on WordPress it's not going to be
18:30
go to chat GPT have chat GPT write it
18:33
for you you copy and paste it into
18:35
WordPress and then you publish it it's
18:37
going to be more like hey go write me an
18:39
article about X and then your AI agent
18:42
goes and does the research writes the
18:43
article copies and pastes it to
18:45
Wordpress for you generates a thumbnail
18:48
image for you and then presses the
18:49
publish button for you so all you did
18:52
was instruct it on what you wanted it to
18:54
do and it did everything beyond that
18:56
point I think that's where like AI AG
18:59
and content creation are going to go Jos
19:01
Marino because of the Jetson ship there
19:02
will be an explosion of entertaining
19:04
robots like Pokemon and other characters
19:06
for kids that would be pretty cool I'd
19:07
love to see that you'll see a ton of
19:09
video AI produced entertainment in a
19:11
fraction of the time it'll allow
19:12
creators to get their voices out there
19:14
instead of spending weeks to produce
19:15
something similar Zoom says this year
19:17
will be about implementing AI in the
19:19
workspace effectively and have it be
19:21
able to carefully complete task by
19:23
itself Yeah so basically like the agent
19:25
sort of stuff we need AI that reliably
19:27
produces results and that doesn't need
19:28
too much supervising agreed yeah that's
19:31
that's where I think like the AI agent
19:32
stuff is really going to happen this
19:33
year it will cause a great deal of
19:34
confusion devising ways to discern truth
19:37
from fiction will become a huge priority
19:39
totally agree I think we're already
19:41
there with AI images I think people are
19:43
already pretty good at creating AI
19:44
images that can fake people out and make
19:46
them think they're real I think we're
19:47
going to get there with video in 2025 in
19:49
fact I'm very confident we're going to
19:51
be there with video in 20125 Raymond L
19:54
predicts that we'll have the first
19:55
Global incident caused by an AI agent
19:58
going hey wire I hope not but you know
20:00
there's going to be people in their
20:01
basements trying to figure out how to
20:02
wreak havoc with these various AI models
20:05
Sir Charles says AI will make its way
20:07
into some big movies one way or the
20:08
other and not only the title thing yeah
20:11
I agree I mean I think we're already
20:12
seeing it we're already seeing AI help
20:14
replace faces with like deceased actors
20:16
and using AI to get like voice over and
20:20
things like that so I I really think
20:22
we're already starting to see it I think
20:24
that a lot of Hollywood and a lot of
20:26
game studios and things like that are
20:28
going to sort of hide the fact that
20:29
they're using AI at least in the near
20:31
term because they know there's some
20:32
backlash but I think a lot of these
20:34
companies are already using it they're
20:35
just not talking about it as much Victor
20:37
thinks that we'll have the movie her
20:39
next year but using AR glasses instead
20:41
of earbuds I can see that I mean with
20:43
project Astra I've already started to
20:45
get glimpses of that if we get the
20:46
advanced voice mode with chat GPT but in
20:49
glasses I think you know you get that
20:51
kind of scenario Nu says I want to see
20:53
an AI that takes video camera and
20:55
microphone as an input and produces
20:57
video as an output depending on what the
20:59
input is the output could be an avatar
21:01
conversing or graphical illustration or
21:03
a movie whatever makes the most sense
21:04
for the input video I would love to see
21:06
that I don't know if we're going to get
21:06
that in 2025 I'm pretty sure that uh
21:09
Google is working on trying to do that
21:11
inside of Gemini I mean their model is
21:13
multimodal from the start so it can
21:15
understand video I don't know how well
21:17
it can produce video yet but it can
21:19
understand video and then when you look
21:20
at open AI you know they're trying to
21:22
add video understanding as well but they
21:24
also have a platform that outputs video
21:25
in Sora you know Google has VO2 so both
21:28
of these platforms have models that can
21:30
output video both of these platforms are
21:33
able to take in video you would think
21:35
they would get there soon whether we see
21:37
that in 2025 or not I'm not sure
21:39
self-improving AI agents full length
21:41
movies AI generated games AI agents AI
21:44
agent takeover Greg says AI gets
21:47
personal smart assistants that truly
21:49
know you ethics take Center Stage
21:51
stronger regulation and Frameworks to
21:52
ensure responsible AI development I'm
21:54
really hoping for this as well
21:56
creativity goes hybrid AI becomes a true
21:57
creative partner revolutionizing how we
21:59
make art music and content yeah that one
22:01
I think we're already there I think
22:03
people that really understand and
22:04
leverage AI are already kind of using it
22:06
as a partner not as like the only tool
22:08
like me personally I create art in mid
22:11
journey and Leonardo and idiogram and
22:14
all these various places and I pull it
22:15
together in Photoshop and then I throw
22:17
it into canva to add some like text
22:19
really easy so I'm already kind of
22:21
creating my own art by using a ton of
22:24
different tools and trying to pull it
22:25
all together Richard oconnell says still
22:27
no one will care about Gro I actually
22:29
kind of disagree on that one you know
22:30
Elon is trying to build like the world's
22:32
largest data center he's also trying to
22:34
build an external Gro app that's outside
22:37
of X so if he builds this data center
22:40
and he builds an app outside of X that's
22:43
like chat GPT but like an uncensored
22:45
version I actually think a lot of people
22:46
will care about grock at that point I
22:48
just think a lot of people don't use it
22:49
because you have to use x Twitter to
22:52
actually use grock right now and it's
22:54
not like the best of the large language
22:55
models it's not the best image generator
22:57
anymore it was when it used flux but
22:59
it's not right now but I think when it's
23:00
its own app if they maintain the fact
23:02
that they want it to be like this
23:04
uncensored model that you can do
23:05
anything with I think grock will be very
23:07
very popular among people that want to
23:09
use an uncensored version of a chat GPT
23:12
in a standalone app Tesla full
23:13
self-driving will go unsupervised
23:15
totally agree I think we're seeing that
23:17
in 2025 crypto shrimp the crypto
23:19
solutions for proof of personhood need
23:21
to be developed I do think this is a
23:23
decent use case of blockchain technology
23:26
so I would love to see something bubble
23:28
up that does that well AI compute will
23:30
slow down a bit but its applications
23:32
will become much more embedded and AI
23:33
will have another chat GPT moment I can
23:36
see that restructuring democracy says
23:38
apps become ideas only thing necessary
23:40
AI takes care of the rest that's totally
23:42
the future that I think all of this is
23:43
working towards whether that's 2025 or
23:46
not I don't know but I would love to be
23:48
able to go to a platform and say I need
23:50
an app that does this and it just spits
23:52
out the app and it works the first time
23:54
or I only have to give it one or two
23:56
more prompts to add some features I
23:57
think we'll get there I don't think
23:59
we're too far off from that whether we
24:01
see that in 2025 or not I don't know we
24:03
don't have access to open AI 03 yet
24:06
maybe 03 is capable of doing that kind
24:08
of thing but I don't know yet AI powered
24:10
automation yeah that's kind of like the
24:12
the agent stuff Quantum Computing
24:13
breakthroughs totally agree I mentioned
24:15
that as well extended reality as the new
24:17
Norm XR technologies will become
24:19
mainstream I thought that in 2024 I can
24:21
see it maybe being 2025 but I don't
24:24
think it's going to be the big headsets
24:25
I don't think it's going to be the meta
24:26
quests or the Apple Vision Pros I think
24:28
it's be more the smaller glasses form
24:30
factors I think it's going to be the
24:32
rayb band metas but with heads up
24:34
displays the Astro glasses with the
24:36
heads up displays built in they've got
24:37
to look like something you would wear
24:39
out normally for them to get adopted in
24:41
my opinion but I do think we will see
24:43
more of it in 20125 like I mentioned
24:45
2025 is the year of Agents agents Galore
24:49
agents going mainstream someone's going
24:51
to do a series of short AI movies that
24:53
will hold up and become popular probably
24:55
on YouTube I can totally see somebody
24:56
creating like a love death and robot
24:58
style show that was all generated with
25:00
AI and does really really well if the
25:03
storytelling and the visuals are both
25:04
there I think you need those two
25:05
elements good storytelling that hooks
25:07
people in and good visuals that don't
25:09
bore people with the visuals glasses
25:11
with real-time streaming functionality
25:13
Google Glasses Apple glasses I don't
25:15
know if Apple's actually going to do any
25:17
sort of glasses maybe but I haven't
25:18
really even heard rumors about Apple
25:20
glasses glasses powered by 01 or 03
25:23
definitely see that happening AI agents
25:25
everywhere custom droids Quantum
25:27
computing regenerative medicine with AI
25:30
I would love to see this happen in 2025
25:33
I just think that um the sort of legal
25:35
roadblocks really really slow this
25:38
portion down cuz I thought this in 2024
25:41
and nothing really manifested as fast as
25:44
I thought it would but these other three
25:45
totally agree with super bullish on
25:47
agents everywhere I would actually love
25:49
to see this so Thomas Chapman here says
25:51
someone will build a system that will
25:53
let you tune your social timeline
25:55
algorithm just by expressing your taste
25:57
and preferences that would be great so
25:59
like never show me a post about blank
26:01
ever again and you just won't see stuff
26:02
like that that would be really cool I
26:04
mean I'd love to see X do that I feel
26:06
like a lot of the platforms are
26:07
disincentivized to do that although I
26:10
believe threads already allows you to
26:12
sort of Custom Tailor your feed a little
26:14
bit better than the rest of the
26:15
platforms cyber Mage AI says lots of
26:17
crappy 5 to 10sec AI videos clogging up
26:19
everyone's timelines out of that there
26:21
will be some longer ones that are
26:22
amazing I mean that's now that's today
26:24
right you're already seeing a lot of
26:26
crappy 5 to 10c AI videos clogging up
26:28
timelines uh but I do agree we will see
26:31
some longer ones that are much more
26:32
amazing I've already seen some that are
26:34
like you know 2 or 3 minutes that I'm
26:35
really Blown Away by robotics take off
26:38
AI agents 2025 AI agents AI agents 3D AI
26:43
will continue improving that's another
26:45
thing I didn't mention 3D AI has gotten
26:47
really good with tools like meshy and
26:49
backflip and tripo there's a lot of
26:52
really really good AI to 3D object
26:55
platforms now where you can go and 3D
26:57
print them or move them into Unreal
26:58
Engine or pull them into mixamo and
27:01
animate them we've already seen those
27:03
tools get pretty good I do think we're
27:05
going to see them get really really good
27:07
in 2025 and maybe that's the next step
27:09
that we need to get more AI in the
27:12
gaming development experience I don't
27:14
know I still think a lot of the gaming
27:15
world is going to reject it and try to
27:17
push back hard I'll go ahead and cut it
27:18
off right there as far as the Twitter
27:20
posts because most of the other posts as
27:21
I scrolled through and we're saying the
27:23
same kind of stuff we're going to see AI
27:24
agents we're going to see AI video get a
27:26
lot better we're going to see leaps in
27:28
Quantum Computing we've got some people
27:30
that think we're going to see some big
27:31
leaps in medicine as a result of AI but
27:34
one thing I can guarantee is we're going
27:35
to get a lot more AI slop and that's one
27:37
thing that I'm not a fan of when it
27:38
comes to AI is just a lot of quickly
27:41
produced junk that people slap up and
27:43
throw up on social media and then you
27:45
get feeds that are clogged with it we're
27:47
going to see that in the form of text
27:49
video audio images all of it not really
27:52
a fan of that but we're definitely going
27:53
to see more of that in 2025 if there's
27:55
one prediction I can say with 100%
27:57
certainty it's that we're going to see
27:58
more AI slop but I'm going to do my best
